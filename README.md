# eVTOL Technical-Economical Operations (TEO) Design Framework

## Overview

This repository hosts the MATLAB code for the eVTOL Technical-Economical Operations (TEO) Design Framework, developed as part of a research project at Imperial College London's Department of Aeronautics. The framework is designed to optimize eVTOL operations by integrating technical, economic, and environmental factors. It enables comprehensive planning and analysis of future eVTOL designs, focusing on multiobjective optimization, aircraft design, operational cost analysis, and environmental impact assessment.

## Features

- **Mission Profile Simulation**: Models standard eVTOL missions, including all phases of flight from takeoff to landing.
- **Aircraft Design Optimization**: Calculates and optimizes key design parameters such as Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM), battery mass, and aerodynamic characteristics.
- **Power and Energy Modeling**: Assesses energy requirements across different flight phases, incorporating battery degradation models.
- **Operational Cost Analysis**: Breaks down costs into cash operating costs, cost of ownership, and indirect operating costs, providing a detailed financial analysis.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Implements a robust MATLAB-based optimization code to balance multiple design and operational objectives.
- **eVTOL Industry Comparison**: A tabular comparison of common EVTOL industrial projects, available as excel sheet, in terms of technological design parameters and operational characteristics (as of August 2024). 

## Usage

To use the TEO Framework, clone this repository and run the provided MATLAB scripts. The framework is modular, allowing for customization of parameters and assumptions to suit specific eVTOL configurations or operational scenarios.
